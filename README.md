# Lua for Visual Studio

It took a little while to set this up, and it relies on some experience gained over several years, so this project might make life easier for some other people. I changed the max path size in luaconf.h from 60 to 2048 and the Visual Studio project is set up ready to build. Other than that, all original files from Lua 5.1.5 have been retained. This is using Lua 5.1.5 and VS 2019 but it should be easy to reconfigure for other versions.
